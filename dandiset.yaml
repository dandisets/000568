description: Understanding how excitatory (E) and inhibitory (I) inputs are integrated
  by neurons requires monitoring their subthreshold behavior. We probed the subthreshold
  dynamics using optogenetic depolarizing pulses in hippocampal neuronal assemblies
  in freely moving mice. Excitability decreased during sharp- wave ripples coupled
  with increased I. In contrast to this “negative gain,” optogenetic probing showed
  increased within-field excitability in place cells by weakening I and unmasked stable
  place fields in initially non–place cells. Neuronal assemblies active during sharp-wave
  ripples in the home cage predicted spatial overlap and sequences of place fields
  of both place cells and unmasked preexisting place fields of non–place cells during
  track running. Thus, indirect probing of subthreshold dynamics in neuronal populations
  permits the disclosing of preexisting assemblies and modes of neuronal operations.
